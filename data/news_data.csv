In a recent announcement, Team Curse revealed that it will charge into the 2015 NA LCS season under a new name.

3,3,Re-introducing Train,"Train is back, available for all CS:GO players right now as part of the Operation Vanguard Map Group!","Train is a memorable and classic Counter-Strike map. We're excited to begin a new chapter in the history of Train by releasing a new and upgraded version for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. We've rebuilt the map from the ground up in order to improve both the visual appearance and competitive gameplay balance of this iconic location. 

Our primary goals were to improve the gameplay balance of the map while simultaneously upgrading the overall visual experience. This meant making more intuitive layout changes, then re-interpreting large and small-scale environment elements to improve judgement of space and distance. Check out the video to see a montage of iterative changes made during development. We've also outlined some in-depth explanations of these changes in more detail below.

Take away the jungler and you simply have laners fighting for cs. Most junglers apply pressure when they leave the jungle, by applying pressure on opposing laners. As such, what makes a good jungler is typically gap-closing ability and CC for strong ganks.Rek’Sai is completely unique as a jungler, in that while she is built more like a standard jungler (complete with gap-closer and CC), she has the capacity of a control jungler built straight into her kit.",2014-12-20,lol_news2.jpg
8,2,The International Grand Finals,Today we play the Grand Finals to decide who will win the Aegis and be crowned Champions.,"At the end of Phase 2 (group stage) there could not have been two teams further apart. VG had dominated the entire set of round robin matches ending on top of the standings with a 12-3 record. Newbee on the other hand, squeaked in with a 7-8 record that forced them into a three way TieBreaker.

VG’s record gave them an instant trip to the Main Event. Newbee’s record gave them the longest road to the main event but that trip forged the team into something new. They no longer struggled, but dominated matches and now enter today from the Upper Bracket and VG comes from the Lower Bracket.

The two have met at KeyArena. Newbee the bottom seed, played VG the top seed to start the Main Event. Newbee is the team that sent VG down to the Lower Bracket that day while they moved on straight to the Grand Finals today. A familiar story but reversed. Has VG’s road back from the Lower Bracket created a team that can now defeat Newbee? Or is Newbee unstoppable?

We find out today, Who will reign supreme?",2014-07-20,dota_news2.jpg

""Our team has created exclusive Divisional Gear for each Division Ranking that will be awarded at the end of each season for use throughout the next season in Ranked Play, Multiplayer, and Exo-Survival. To rise up in the ranks of each Division, players need to reach a total of 100 division points, and then a Division Promotion Challenge (best of three matches).
